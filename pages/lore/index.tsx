              <h3>Act I: J. Powers</h3>
              <p>
                Our tale begins with J. Powers, a man consumed by his own mind (
                <em style={{ position: "relative" }}>
                  <div
                    style={{
                      position: "absolute",
                      top: "-20px",
                      left: "25px",
                    }}

                  Napoleon
                </em>
                ). Lost in fantasies of grandeur and immortality, he escapes
                into delusions where he is revered as a god. But beneath the
                facade lies a broken soul - a narcissist, a liar, desperate to
                blame his failings on anything but himself.
              </p>

              <p>
                Enter the femme fatale. She sees his silver tongue and offers
                him a new life as a conman (<em>The Long Con</em>). Together
                they become a modern Bonnie and Clyde, running schemes and
                stealing identities. Their cons grow more elaborate and
                dangerous - Powers begins selling faulty aircraft parts to
                defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, prioritizing profit
                over safety.
              </p>

              <p>
                The inevitable comes to pass. His house of cards collapses (
                <em>Smile Wide</em>, <em>Keep Out</em>), and J. Powers finds
                himself at the bank, making his final statement (
                <em>Bankrupt</em>). The vault door closes, sealing away not just
                his assets, but his last shred of dignity. In desperation, he
                turns to the occult (<em>Tarot Arcana XVI: The Tower</em>),
                consulting cards and spirits for supernatural solutions to his
                earthly problems.

              <h3>
                Act II: Wolfgang Wallace
                {EyePlacements.LoreChapter2()}
              </h3>
              <p>
                Enter Wolfgang Wallace, a skilled pilot whose fate becomes
                tragically intertwined with Powers' crimes. Flying a Lockheed
                Martin aircraft equipped with J. Powers' faulty parts, Wolfgang
                suddenly finds himself in mortal danger (
                <em>Compulsory Evacuation Device</em>). The defective components
                fail at the worst possible moment, sending his aircraft
                spiraling toward disaster.
              </p>

              <p>
                Wolfgang survives the crash, but barely. He slips into a
                comatose state (<em>Comatose</em>) and is ultimately brought
                back, but has become more machine than man, (
                <em>Automatic Mannequin</em>) suspended between life and death.
                When he finally awakens, he's no longer the man he once was -
                transformed by trauma and loss, driven by a singular purpose: to
                find the man responsible for his suffering.
              </p>

              <h3>Act III: The Dance Macabre</h3>
              <p>
                Wolfgang's investigation leads him to the harbor (
                <em>Harbor</em>), where in his rage and desperation, he
                accidentally kills his own beloved. Consumed by guilt and fury,
                he tracks down J. Powers to face the consequences of his actions
                (<em>Consequences</em>).
              </p>

              <p>
                But Wolfgang's plan is darker than simple revenge. On DÃ­a de los
                Muertos, he performs a bloodstained ritual (
                <em>The Dance Macabre</em>), using J. Powers as a sacrifice in
                an occult ritual to resurrect his lost love. The ritual
                succeeds, but at a terrible cost - both men are transformed in
                the process, merging into something else entirely: The Dark
                Specter. Neither alive nor dead, they exist in the void between
                worlds, forever bound by the consequences of greed, revenge, and
                forbidden love.
