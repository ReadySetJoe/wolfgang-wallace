Headed to the bank to
Make my final statement
It is the equivalent of
Announcing you're a failure you
Treat me like a baboon
To sign a piece of paper
It says I am delayed or
It says I am incapable well

You were the one who could endure it all
You could endure it all, endure it all
Now it appears that I can't anymore
I got a bad credit score, I got a bad credit score

And even if I declare bankrupcy,
I know that I've made it too far
If only my taxes were lowered you see 
then I wouldn't be asking for more

God dammit all 
If you were there you'd know
It's happened once before
But not since I was a boy 

Have you ever seen anything quite like this?
That approaching third world embarrassment,
When all of your family and all of your friends
Begin their gradual abandonment

Well I was the one who could endure it all
You could endure it all, endure it all
Now it appears that I can't anymore
I got a bad credit score, I got a bad credit score

And even if I declare bankrupcy,
I know that I've made it too far
If only my taxes were lowered you see 
then I wouldn't be asking for more

God dammit all 
If you were there you'd know
It's happened once before
But not since I was a boy 

Time to call it like it is
And you can write this on my epitaph
I've run out of oxygen
Cause when the vault door closes
It'll never open back 

God dammit all 
If you were there you'd know
It's happened once before
But not since I was a boy
