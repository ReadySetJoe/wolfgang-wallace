Its time to wake up
Get out of bed
Consult the daily charts that tell me instead
Its been a good week
The second best
Day that you have had
Since the incident

IThis isnt real youre in a coma
Youll ignore the
Constant beeping
Keeps you breathing
From your hospital bed

I know youre smiling
By the way I see your eyelids
Flutter lightly
Recognize me
Somethings on in your head

Ever since your comatosin'
All this time I didnt notice
Bottle kept inside's a photo
I'll be right here anticipatin'

Doctor said its now or never
Your choice to pull the lever
Machine has got you tethered
I'll be right here anticipatin'

Oh my beloved
You've about ten seconds left
Before they pull the plug by force
Cause Ive run out of cash
10, 9, 8, 7...
I'll be right here anticipatin'
