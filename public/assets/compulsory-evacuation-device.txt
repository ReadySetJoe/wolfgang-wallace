Aviation casualties
Hapen more often than I'd like to admit
Conversation tragically
Crashes with the hornet in the landing strip

All hands on deck they said over emergency PA
The hatch is jammed inside and all the wires cut and frayed
Maybe someone will hear the banging

Cant fly away
I'll run out of gasoline
And I can see it from here, there's a fire on the runway

Evacuate
I'll run out of battery
Life for my device that was compulsory

Why in the winter season
Carbon monoxide's leakin'
Everyone else is leavin'

Me all alone
I have to face on my own

This wasnt worth the wages
I gave up my salvation
Oh so long ago

There's no escape
I'll freeze to death under the Bering Strait
And I can see it from here there's a fire on the runway

Is it too late
To write a note to my family
The water's rising too quickly, my muscles starting to give away

I have to ask you if you'll marry me
Within this bottle was no suffering
It was your favorite photo, I apologize
It was the only thing I could keep dry
