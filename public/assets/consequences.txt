I saw a light today
I got a message from beyond the grave

It said

I found him
The time is now to
Leave town and 
Track him down 

He's hiding
In Mexico
We'll get there in time for
Dio De Los muertos

Drop your defenses
There don't seem to be any consequences

What a perfect scene this turned out to be
When the Harvest Moon it spoke to me
It said

I'll follow
If you leave me
Let's start the hunt
Throughout Mexico City 

He's bout 6 foot
2 inches
His height advantage won't make
Much a difference

Drop your defenses
There don't seem to be many consequences

You're taking all of the fun out of it
Cause I love to see some struggling
From my victims

Your name's the first one on my list
Feels like I've waited my whole life for this
Oh yeah there's nothing like revenge 
I'll nail him in a coffin
Once I start the Dance Macabre-in

He'll say

Let me out of here man
I've run out of oxygen
Cause I'm trapped inside a casket
This time I just can't laugh it off 
Hahahahaha
