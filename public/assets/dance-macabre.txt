Talking to my ouija board
The devil's gonna solve all of my problems

Popping out from my keyboard
Messages to keep the man content

I'm gonna resurrect her
Sit through another lecture
Fighting with education
Loopholes in divination
Takes more than a sacrifice
When you get home
Won't that be nice

Ask me another question
Ask this on any other day
You would disintegrate

Would you do me the honor?
Make sure they drown in alcohol
We'll do the dance macabre

Following along
On dio de los muertos

Finally alone
No more zombies, ghouls, and ghosts

Halloweens almost over
No longer in October
Candles lit in my attic
It's gonna work god dammit

I'll no longer be alone
My baby's comin' home for good
Just like I said you would

Was it worth it? she asked
For you, of course it is
