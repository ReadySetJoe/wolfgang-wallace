Won't someone help me out here
My love's grown so insincere
Think I've figured out whats wrong
Think I've known it all along

Its the seperate road you've taken
Strip off your clothes butt naked
I would have been there if not for the coma
I'm a betrayed, abandoned, mechanical soldier

I know it's not right
But I have the same dream every night
Where I have my hands around your throat
I shove your body in a boat
I take you out on the harbor - douse you in cement
And I drop you down to the bottom of it
And no one ever misses you
No one ever misses you

Except me
Except me

He's got the mind of a genius and shoulders so broad
The eyes of an eagle the chest of a god
Maybe I can look like him if I drown in protein
But that culture and intellect I just cant compete

Break down an hour later
Safe now to contemplate her
Her actions against you stop hyping it up
Its only making things worse but I can't seem to stop

And I'll hide in a hole and I'll die all alone
Until I learn to handle this
But you can help me a little if we speak again
Just tell me you're sorry you don't have to mean it

And under the harbor you'll always remain
And every harvest moon you'll come back again
As the light of lands end - a faint will o wisp
To guide horny teenagers straight to their deaths
And I'll be there watching you ensure their doom
Constantly recording to always make sure that
No one ever misses you
That no one ever misses you

Except me
