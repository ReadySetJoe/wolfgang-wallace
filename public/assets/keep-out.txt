"Keep out" 
In big red letters
On a chain link fence wrapped around the yard
The kind of solitude I've always wanted to
Escape this life from the start

She said it looks like I've aged 15 years in the last 2
A failure to try but I know that I have to
Capitalize on this moment of weakness
If I go to prison I'll always repeat this:

My daddy owns a lot of land
And he'll be dyin' pretty soon
I'm bound to inherit most of it
And maybe I could share some of it with you

We'll start a farm together
And I can forecast the weather
We'll be a harvester meteorologist team
Only go into town to refill gasoline

Oh please just come with me
I think I'm losing my mind
If we use some financial good sense this time
Sparse it out for the rest of our lives

Keep out
Keep out
Keep out
