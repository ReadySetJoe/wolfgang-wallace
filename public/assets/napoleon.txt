I’ve done the calculations
I spent twenty-two
Out of every twenty-four
Hours alone
For the two I’m not home
I spend dissociating with myself in some kind of


Role-play
Though a therapist might call it escapism
It’s more than imagination
Or ADD
It’s a problem
Can’t stop it
I can’t keep my mind of it

So I’ll
Live in a fantasy where I was more successful
Why stop there when I can make myself immortal?

Here comes the tall man
Here comes our God
We’re so glad he exists ‘cause we care about him
He’s our Napoleon

I’ll be okay in a second I guess
Tied to hypochondriasis
Everything has gotta be a bit more evil
Or hyped up like every problem I have with myself like
My hairline
My height and
My voice and
My job
I’m a little bitch who can’t say no
I don’t know when a joke should stop

And I’m a maniac
I’m a narcissist
I’m a liar
I’m a slob
I’ve been running low on gasoline retreat inside my thoughts where I’ll
Live in a fantasy where I was more successful
Why stop there when I can make myself immortal?

It’s getting worse I feel it
From my skull I carve out my brain
Throw it under a microscope and
Surely there’s a tumor
Or something to explain
A fraction of what’s wrong with me
I promise it’s something
It’s not who I am
It’s chemicals
It’s biology
It’s me
It’s me
