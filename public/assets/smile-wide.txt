Nine times I've gone it over
Its racing round my head
Repeating every sound
Every word I could have said

Don't you think you might be jumping the gun
You just left me for a little while a mother and her son
And I gotta lotta fucking problems locked inside my brain
But your voice soothes almost all em, washes them away

Smile wide
The camera’s flashin’
I'm sick of all this constant fashion it's like
Nothing’s real
Why do I always feel
Like I'm trapped inside a casket
This time I just cant laugh it off
Hahahahaha

I know its overrated
You know I will investigate
Each day feels so belated
I'm running from the good old days

How longs it been since Harvest
I've been waiting every day
Plants dead inside the garden
But your voice soothes almost all em washes them away oh

Polaroid film and pennies
All on the floor I'm giving
Up on this, problems persist
But your voice soothes almost all em, washes them away
