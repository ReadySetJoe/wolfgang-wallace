I'm out of sympathy and serotonin
A neon sign reads "open"
For a fortune teller
So I tell her
Bout my problems
I wanna know about my future
They say you're legit or at least that's the rumor
She said the first one's free
I can sense you need this

Tarot
Looks like you've drawn the tower
Your destiny
From what I read, catastrophe
Is spelled out in your palm
You got 7 days til Halloween
Until the Dance Macabre

And then? What happens then!?
I think you know.

No boy, the deck never lies
I've been toying with the idea of explaining
All of the karma you've accumulated
Is comin' around and their aint no escapin

Your fate
It's got a certain ring to it, don't it?
The image of your fetal body decomposin' under this weight
And nowhere's safe from him
You deserve this

Smile Wide, the camera's flashing for
The long con
You played on Lockheed Martin?
You sold those parts to them
And they were counterfeit.
And he knows it was you
He knows it was you
He knows it was me?
Fuck.
