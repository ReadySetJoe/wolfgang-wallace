She said I've got a way with words a silver tongue
Sick of my old life run away with her
And be a conman

This Bonnie and Clyde routine
I can't keep it up
It's so exhausting
And so impersonal
It's weighing at my spirit
Weighing down my soul
Densensitization I'm losing control

I guess I'll run the con
I'll be your henchman
Nothing can stop us but divine intervention
I can't stare for too long 
In my reflection
I've been cursed by the dead and damned by the sentient
But it's not one and done like you said before
I've every intention to leave when you're done

Well maybe I get off to hurting the poor
It's just darwinism if I don't get caught
'Cause I run
I run the long con

By now I'm sure you've noticed
I'm not the kind of people you said we would turn into
The number in my bank account is any indication

We can stop now baby
I've built the kind of safety egg
To feed us for life
Just hide from the IRS
They've issued an audit
Who's gonna fix this mess

I got your social security number
I steal your identity while you're slumber
Ing and I know every secret you have
Professional blackmail
My final demand
